    "Having recreated and validated found results of de Boer (2000) together with a less ad hoc variant of the Bark Operator we shift our focus on extending de Boer (2000).\n",
    "As we discuss in the report, this extension is in changing the interaction network of the agents.\n",
    "Instead of randomly picking a speaker and and imitator, we use a selection strategy based on a small community.\n",
